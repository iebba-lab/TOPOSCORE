_Custom scoring based on ecological topology of gut microbiota associated with cancer immunotherapy outcome._*
The gut microbiota influences clinical responses of cancer patients to immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, there is no consensus definition of detrimental dysbiosis. Based on metagenomics (MG) sequencing of 245 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patient feces, we constructed species-level co-abundance networks that were clustered into species interacting groups (SIG) correlating with overall survival. Thirty-seven and 45 MG species were associated with resistance (SIG1) and response (SIG2) to ICI, respectively. If combined with the quantification of Akkermansia species, this procedure allowed a person-based calculation of a topological score (TOPOSCORE) that was validated in additional 254 NSCLC patients and in 216 genitourinary cancers. Finally, this TOPOSCORE was translated into a 21 bacterial probe set-based qPCR- scoring that was validated in a prospective cohort of NSCLC patients, as well as in colorectal and melanoma patients. This approach could represent a dynamic diagnosis tool of intestinal dysbiosis to guide personalized microbiota-centered interventions.
